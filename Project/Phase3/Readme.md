## Project Report ##

## Introduction ##
This project is all about Chocopy language compiler. In this project I have used ChocoPy language. ChocoPy is a programming language designed for classroom use in undergraduate compilers courses. ChocoPy is a restricted subset of Python 3, which can easily be compiled to a target. The language is fully specified using formal grammar, typing rules, and operational semantics. I have built this project using LEX (lexical analyzer generator) and YACC (yet another compiler compiler). Lex and yacc are tools used to generate lexical analyzers and parsers.

## Aim ##
The main aim on this project is to learn and practically implements the concepts of Compiler Construction. 

## Platform ##

The platform used is Ubunto 20.04 LTS or any other UNIX platform which supports C language along with lex and yacc.



## Course Concepts ##
we have deployed two main concepts/phases in my project:
1. Lexical Analyzer: (In this particular phase, we have wrote some scripts to divide our C Language code into useful Tokens.
2. Syntax Analyzer: (In this particular phase, we have wrote an algorithm that translates a program written in C programming language into python..
we have also worked on Line structures, comments section of code, removing blank/white spaces, identifying identifiers, and intensifying literals and delimiters. we have also wrote and algorithm  for python programs (e.g. methods/functions, class, statements, variables, literals, expressions, Ops etc.).
